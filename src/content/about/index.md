Sockethub is a generic web service for sending and receiving messages on the 
web, from client-side applications or websites. All communication is represented 
in simple JSON objects, allowing front-end developers to write 
[dream code](http://nobackend.org/dreamcode.html) without worry about protocol 
details and other complexities.


By implementing a polyglot server that can speak all of the various protocols 
and APIs of the web today, Sockethub exposes a single abstracted interface to 
application developers to carry out messaging and social tasks. This open-source web 
service adds one more building block to 
the goals of [unhosted](http://unhosted.org) and [nobackend](http://nobackend.org), 
which is to provide *"server-independent, server-side functionality"*, so that 
front-end application developers can interface with these generic open-services 
free from vendor lock-in.
